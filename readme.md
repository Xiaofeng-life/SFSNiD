Division of the number of training and test images: 
We provide the division ratios in the supplementary material.
Currently, there is little research on nighttime dehazing. We noticed that different papers use different division ratios. 
This may lead to different results for datasets such as NHM and NightHaze.

### Step 2. Supervised Training
Follow step 1 to put the synthetic data into the corresponding folder.

```
cd task_SFSNiD
python train_SFSNiD_supervised.py --results_dir ../results/MyNightDehazing/train_SFSNiD_supervised/NHR/ \
                                  --img_h 256 --img_w 256 --train_batch_size 4 \
                                  --dataset NHR --total_epoches 100 --lr 0.0001 \
                                  --device cuda:0 --num_res 3
```


### Step 3. Semi-supervised Training

#### step 3.1. generate pseudo labels

Reduce the brightness of UNREAL-NH's hazy and haze-free images through Gamma correction, 
which can be obtained in Generate_Dark_UNREALNH.sh We call this dataset UNREAL_NH_No_Sky_Dark.

The pseudo labels for the real-world hazy images are generated by

Note: Images with blue sky can be deleted for better real-world performance. 
The names of the images in UNREAL_NH_No_Sky_Dark are in UNREAL_NH_No_Sky_Dark.txt.


```
cd task_SFSNiD
python Generate_PseudoLabel.py --net SFSNiD \
                               --results_dir ../results/MyNightDehazing/RWNHC_MM23_pseudo_labels/ \
                               --img_h 256 --img_w 256 \
                               --pth_path ../results/MyNightDehazing/train_SFSNiD_supervised/UNREAL_NH_NoSKy_Dark/models/last_SFSNiD_UNREAL_NH_NoSky_Dark.pth \
                               --dataset RWNHC_MM23
```

Note: RWNHC_MM23 is a subset from the real-world nighttime hazy images, which can be downloaded from "Enhancing visibility in nighttime haze images using guided apsf and gradient adaptive convolution"

#### step 3.2. semi-supervised training

Follow the Step 1. to put the synthetic data (UNREAL_NH_No_Sky_Dark) and real-world data (pseudo labels generated by Step 3.1) into the corresponding folders.
We name the new dataset as "RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel". A demo dataset for "RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel" is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQ0TTg38Kyr1MYl8cu4bLGya5qgDrlGh/view?usp=drive_link


```
python train_SFSNiD_semi_supervised.py --results_dir ../results/MyNightDehazing/train_SFSNiD_semi_supervised/RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel_kappa130/ \
                                       --img_h 256 --img_w 256 --train_batch_size 4 --dataset RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel \
                                       --total_epoches 20 --lr 0.0001 --device cuda:0 --num_res 3 \
                                       --patch_size 16 --bri_ratio 100 --bri_weight 20 --kappa 130
```


### 4. Inference on Real-World 

```
cd task_SFSNiD
python inference_real_world.py --net SFSNiD \
                               --results_dir ../results/MyNightDehazing/RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel_kappa130_results/ \
                               --img_h 256 --img_w 256 \
                               --pth_path ../results/MyNightDehazing/train_SFSNiD_semi_supervised/RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel_kappa130/models/last_SFSNiD_/RWNHC_MM23_PseudoLabel.pth \
                               --dataset RWNHC_MM23
```


### 5. Different Brightness in Real-world

Recently, several researchers are interested in the “Figure 7. 
Dehazed images obtained under different κ” in the paper.
I retrained the ablation experiments with different kappa.
I sent them the weights by email. 
The settings of the ablation experiment are basically the same as those of the main experiment. 
The epochs of the ablation experiment are less than those of the main experiment.
However, the visual results are basically the same.

If you are also interested, I put the weights of different kappa in 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmyAHup29wJJyqk2dTzd71BWtL7DNU-M/view?usp=drive_link

This link contains all real-world dehazed images. 
And the weights can be directly used for real-world inference.


### 6. Discussions about Real-world 
Some researchers emailed me to discuss nighttime dehazing: Is synthetic data reliable?

My experience is: 
On the synthetic dataset, as the iterations proceed, the PSNR and SSIM of the model tend to be stable/higher.
However, in the real world, the real-world visual results obtained in different epochs may be unstable.
After all, we do not have a metric to measure the real-world dehazing effect.
So, my experience is that you should not use the metrics (PSNR) obtained on synthetic data to judge the dehazing performance in the real world. 
Sometimes the conclusions obtained may be the opposite.
